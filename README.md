This project is a sample of how I work with Flutter. For this example I'm using:

MobX for state manager.

https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api?language=pt-BR for the API.

Dio for http request (RESTfull).

Using clean architecture for the project trying to include all the principles of SOLID.

OBS: the current project still ongoing and has no date to be finished
